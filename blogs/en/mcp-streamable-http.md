[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.claudemcp.com) is a standard protocol for communication between AI models and tools. As AI applications grow increasingly complex and widely deployed, the original communication mechanisms face a series of challenges. [PR #206](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/206) on GitHub introduces a brand-new `Streamable HTTP` transport layer, representing a significant improvement over the original HTTP+SSE transport mechanism. This article provides a detailed analysis of the protocol's design philosophy, technical specifics, and practical applications.

## Original HTTP+SSE Transport Mechanism and Its Limitations

![HTTP+SSE Transport Mechanism](/images/blog/mcp-http-sse.png)

In the original MCP implementation, clients and servers communicate through two main channels:

- **HTTP Request/Response**: Clients send messages to the server via standard HTTP requests
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: The server pushes messages to clients through a dedicated `/sse` endpoint

### Key Issues

While this design is straightforward, it presents several critical problems:

**No Support for Reconnection/Recovery**

When an SSE connection drops, all session states are lost, forcing clients to re-establish the connection and reinitialize the entire session. For example, a large file analysis task in progress would be completely interrupted due to unstable WiFi, requiring users to restart the entire process.

**Servers Must Maintain Long-Lived Connections**

Servers must maintain long-lived SSE connections for each client, leading to significant resource consumption with high concurrency. When servers need to restart or scale, all connections are interrupted, impacting user experience and system reliability.

**Server Messages Can Only Be Delivered via SSE**

Even for simple request-response interactions, servers must return information through the SSE channel, creating unnecessary complexity and overhead. Certain environments (e.g., cloud functions) are unsuitable for maintaining long-lived SSE connections.

**Infrastructure Compatibility Limitations**

Many existing web infrastructures—such as CDNs, load balancers, and API gateways—may not properly handle long-lived SSE connections. Enterprise firewalls might forcibly terminate timed-out connections, resulting in unreliable service.

## Streamable HTTP: Design and Principles

Streamable HTTP is built on the following core principles:

- **Maximized Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing HTTP ecosystems
- **Flexibility**: Support for both stateless and stateful modes
- **Resource Efficiency**: On-demand resource allocation, avoiding unnecessary long-lived connections
- **Reliability**: Support for reconnection and session recovery

### Key Improvements

Compared to the original mechanism, Streamable HTTP introduces several critical enhancements:

1. **Unified Endpoint**: Removes the dedicated `/sse` endpoint, consolidating all communication through a single endpoint (e.g., `/message`)
2. **On-Demand Streaming**: Servers can flexibly choose between returning standard HTTP responses or upgrading to SSE streams
3. **Session Identification**: Introduces a session ID mechanism to support state management and recovery
4. **Flexible Initialization**: Clients can actively initialize SSE streams via empty GET requests

### Technical Details

The workflow of Streamable HTTP is as follows:

1. **Session Initialization**:

   - Clients send initialization requests to the `/message` endpoint
   - Servers may generate and return a session ID to the client
   - The session ID is used to identify the session in subsequent requests

2. **Client-to-Server Communication**:

   - All messages are sent via HTTP POST requests to the `/message` endpoint
   - If a session ID exists, it is included in the request

3. **Server Response Methods**:

   - **Standard Response**: Returns a direct HTTP response, suitable for simple interactions
   - **Streaming Response**: Upgrades the connection to SSE, sends a series of events, then closes
   - **Long-Lived Connection**: Maintains an SSE connection for continuous event delivery

4. **Active SSE Stream Establishment**:

   - Clients can send GET requests to the `/message` endpoint to actively establish SSE streams
   - Servers can push notifications or requests through this stream

5. **Connection Recovery**:

   - If a connection drops, clients can reconnect using the previous session ID
   - Servers can restore session states and resume prior interactions

## Practical Application Scenarios

### Stateless Server Mode

**Scenario**: Simple tool API services, such as mathematical calculations or text processing.

**Implementation**:

```
Client                                  Server
   |                                    |
   |-- POST /message (calculation req) ->|
   |                                    |-- Executes calculation
   |<------- HTTP 200 (result) ---------|
   |                                    |
```

**Advantage**: Minimal deployment, no state management required, suitable for serverless architectures and microservices.

### Streaming Progress Feedback Mode

**Scenario**: Long-running tasks, such as large file processing or complex AI generation.

**Implementation**:

```
Client                                  Server
   |                                    |
   |-- POST /message (process req) ----->|
   |                                    |-- Starts processing task
   |<------- HTTP 200 (SSE starts) -----|
   |                                    |
   |<------- SSE: 10% progress ----------|
   |<------- SSE: 30% progress ----------|
   |<------- SSE: 70% progress ----------|
   |<------- SSE: Complete + result -----|
   |                                    |
```

**Advantage**: Provides real-time feedback without requiring permanent connection states.

### Complex AI Session Mode

**Scenario**: Multi-turn AI assistants requiring context maintenance.

**Implementation**:

```
Client                                  Server
   |                                    |
   |-- POST /message (initialize) ------>|
   |<-- HTTP 200 (session ID: abc123) --|
   |                                    |
   |-- GET /message (session ID: abc123)|
   |<------- SSE stream established ----|
   |                                    |
   |-- POST /message (Q1, abc123) ------>|
   |<------- SSE: Thinking... ----------|
   |<------- SSE: Answer 1 -------------|
   |                                    |
   |-- POST /message (Q2, abc123) ------>|
   |<------- SSE: Thinking... ----------|
   |<------- SSE: Answer 2 -------------|
```

**Advantage**: Maintains session context, supports complex interactions, and enables horizontal scaling.

### Disconnection Recovery Mode

**Scenario**: AI applications in unstable network environments.

**Implementation**:

```
Client                                  Server
   |                                    |
   |-- POST /message (initialize) ------>|
   |<-- HTTP 200 (session ID: xyz789) --|
   |                                    |
   |-- GET /message (session ID: xyz789)|
   |<------- SSE stream established ----|
   |                                    |
   |-- POST /message (long task, xyz789)|
   |<------- SSE: 30% progress ----------|
   |                                    |
   |     [Network interruption]         |
   |                                    |
   |-- GET /message (session ID: xyz789)|
   |<------- SSE stream re-established -|
   |<------- SSE: 60% progress ----------|
   |<------- SSE: Complete -------------|
```

**Advantage**: Improves reliability in weak network conditions, enhancing user experience.
