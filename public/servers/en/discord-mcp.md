## üî¨ Installation

#### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaseQ/discord-mcp
```

#### Build the project
> NOTE: Maven installation is required to use the mvn command. Full instructions can be found [here](https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac).
```bash
cd discord-mcp
mvn clean package # The jar file will be available in the /target directory
```

#### Configure AI client
Many code editors and other AI clients use a configuration file to manage MCP servers.

The Discord MPC server can be configured by adding the following to your configuration file.

> NOTE: You will need to create a Discord Bot token to use this server. Instructions on how to create a Discord Bot token can be found [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord-mcp": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": [
        "-jar",
        "/absolute/path/to/discord-mcp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DISCORD_TOKEN": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
        "DISCORD_GUILD_ID": "OPTIONAL_DEFAULT_SERVER_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` environment variable is optional. When provided, it sets a default Discord server ID so any tool that accepts a `guildId` parameter can omit it.


## üîß GitMCP

Use Discord MCP remotely via [GitMCP](https://gitmcp.io/):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://gitmcp.io/SaseQ/discord-mcp"
      ],

        "DISCORD_TOKEN": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
        "DISCORD_GUILD_ID": "OPTIONAL_DEFAULT_SERVER_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Set `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` here as well if you want to automatically target a specific server.
