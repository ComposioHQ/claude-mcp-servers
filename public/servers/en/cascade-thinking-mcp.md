Transform linear problem-solving into rich, multi-dimensional exploration with true branching and intelligent thought management.

## Features

- **True Branching**: Create separate exploration paths that automatically start new sequences
- **Thought Revision**: Update earlier insights as understanding evolves
- **Dynamic Expansion**: Expand thinking space by 50% or at least 3 more thoughts when needed
- **Multi-Tool Integration**: Persistent state across tools with `toolSource` tracking
- **Flexible Output**: Control verbosity with minimal, standard, or verbose response modes
- **Dual Numbering System**: Track thoughts with both sequence-relative (S{n}) and absolute (A{n}) positions

## Why Cascade Thinking?

Traditional problem-solving tools break under ambiguity. Cascade Thinking MCP lets you:
- Explore alternatives with true branching that creates separate sequences
- Revise previous thoughts with full traceability
- Maintain context across agents and tools with persistent state
- Expand dynamically when you discover complexity mid-exploration

## API

### Tools

- **cascade_thinking**
  - Facilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process with dynamic branching and revision capabilities
  - Key inputs:
    - `thought` (string): The current thinking step
    - `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
    - `thoughtNumber` (string): Current position in sequence (e.g., "S1", "S2", "S3")
    - `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed
    - `branchFromThought` (optional): Create a new branch from specified thought
    - `needsMoreThoughts` (optional): Dynamically expand totalThoughts
    - `responseMode` (optional): Control verbosity (minimal/standard/verbose)

## Unique Features

### Dual Numbering System
- **S{n}**: Sequence-relative position (resets per branch)
- **A{n}**: Absolute position across all thoughts (never resets)

### True Branching
When you branch, the tool:
1. Creates a new sequence automatically
2. Resets numbering to S1 in the new branch
3. Copies relevant context from the parent sequence
4. Tracks the branch relationship for navigation

### Dynamic Expansion
When you set `needsMoreThoughts: true`:
1. Increases totalThoughts by 50% or minimum 3 thoughts
2. Shows visual indicators including âš¡ emoji
3. Updates response with new total
4. Adds hint text to indicate expansion

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "cascade-thinking-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage with Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cascade-thinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp/cascade-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Usage

Start exploring:
```json
{
  "thought": "Analyzing authentication options for our API",
  "thoughtNumber": "S1",
  "totalThoughts": 3,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}
```

Branch to explore OAuth:
```json
{
  "thought": "Let me explore OAuth2 implementation",
  "thoughtNumber": "S1",
  "branchFromThought": "A1",
  "branchId": "oauth-exploration",
  "totalThoughts": 4,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}
```
